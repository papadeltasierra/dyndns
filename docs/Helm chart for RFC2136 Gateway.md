# Helm chart for RFC2136 Gateway
Below is a clean, production‑ready Helm chart skeleton for your RFC2136 Gateway running on AKS.
It’s written in pure Markdown, so you can paste it directly into your repo.

This chart includes:
- Deployment
- Service (UDP + TCP on port 53)
- ConfigMap
- Secret (referencing Key Vault CSI if you choose)
- Values file
- Chart metadata

It’s intentionally minimal but structured for real‑world use.
